## 2024-05-24 - Per-User Rate Limiting on Password Reset
**Vulnerability:** IP-based rate limiting on the password reset endpoint could be bypassed (e.g. via proxy or distributed IPs), allowing attackers to spam targeted user emails by repeatedly requesting password resets.
**Learning:** Returning a generic success message prevents email enumeration, but without per-user rate limiting, the endpoint remains vulnerable to email spam and resource exhaustion.
**Prevention:** Implement per-user rate limits (e.g. checking the `passwordResetExpiry` time of the user's existing token) in addition to global IP rate limits.
