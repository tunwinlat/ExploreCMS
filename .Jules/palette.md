## 2026-03-15 - Missing Dialog Roles in Custom Modals
**Learning:** Found an app-wide accessibility issue where custom modals (like SearchBox and the generic Modal component) are missing essential ARIA roles (`role="dialog"` and `aria-modal="true"`). This prevents screen readers from correctly identifying the modal context and restricting interaction to the modal contents.
**Action:** Add `role="dialog"` and `aria-modal="true"` to modal container elements across the application to ensure screen reader users understand when a modal is active.
## 2024-03-24 - Interactive Grid Items Accessibility
**Learning:** Interactive div elements used as buttons (e.g., photo grid items) are completely ignored by keyboard navigation, making features like the Lightbox inaccessible to non-mouse users.
**Action:** Always add `tabIndex={0}`, `role="button"`, and an `onKeyDown` handler (listening for Enter/Space) to `div`s that act as clickable cards or grid items.
